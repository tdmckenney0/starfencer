# Starfencer

A shoot-em-up game developed in a few weeks of spare time by Tanner Mckenney. 

## Controls

**Arrow keys** move up, down, left, and right. 

Press **Space** to shoot. 

## Gameplay

Ships move back-and-forth to shoot you, the player. They also will randomly rush the player in a kamikaze attack (this instantly destroys the player). 

The ships vary by speed, health, and damage. Orange ships are level 1 ships, whereas green ships are level 2. Each wave will see the roster randomly pick from a growing list (of increasing difficulty) of ships. The better the ship, the more points you rack-up on destruction. 

See who can score the most points before being destroyed. 

Enjoy!
